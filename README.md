# Cootie_Catcher
A Cootie Catcher game using Java

Create a Cootie class that contains private data for the messages and final choice.  The messages will use an Array or ArrayList size 8 for each of the messages on the cootie catcher. 

There is also  a method to allow the user to makeChoice().  They first choose a color.  The color selected will allow different numbers to display based upon the number of letters the color has.  For example.  Should they choose "blue" the cootie catcher would toggle back and forth between the numbers 1, 2, 5, 6 and 3, 4, 7, 8 as the choices.  Since it is even, it would end on 1, 2, 5, 6 and from their the user could make their second choice.  Had it been "red" with only three letters, the cootie catcher would have ended up with 3, 4, 7, 8 as the numbers for the second choice.
